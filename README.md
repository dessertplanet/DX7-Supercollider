### Aziz Ege Gonul's accurate Yamaha DX-7 clone. Extended to run on Organelle M

## Intro from Aziz's README

This is a super-exact clone of DX7 in SC environment. This project began with my internship at the STEIM during the last year; I was able to get my hands on an original DX7 synth and eventually found out that this instrument has this mystic / unusual sound. So I started fiddling with it and did some experiments with Supercollider. After a while, it became an obsession to play with it and started to copy parts of its synth mechanism just to flex my DSP muscles. Sooner, I found myself in this vast project to clone the entire thing. After 2-3 months of implementing process and lots of sleepless nights. I was able to clone the entire DX7 engine with very high accurate results. Other than the DX7â€™s vintage sound hiss, it is hard to distinguish between the clone and the original one on the same presets. For my use, I collected some 16384 (2^14) DX7 Sysex bank presets from the internet and converted it to some integer sequences to read it from Supercollider. I am also combining this clone with this 16384 preset package. Have fun!
